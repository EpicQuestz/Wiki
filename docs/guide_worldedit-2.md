### What are brushes?
Brushes are another tool that you will use a lot in W/E. Unlike the wand, brushes are not specific items that automatically work with the plugin. A brush can be any item, but you have to use a command to make it a brush in the first place.

Brushes allow you to simply right-click with them, to change the blocks you're pointing at. Similar to a real brush, you can hold/spam right-click and drag the crosshair over the screen.

Personally, I like using shovels as brushes, so that's what I will use for the rest of this guide.


### Creating a brush
:::note Usage
`//br [type] [block] [radius]`
:::
1. First, get an item that you want to turn into a brush.
1. Hold it and use the command above, choosing a type explained below (or any other!).
1. "What type do I choose?" There are plenty of different brush types, in this guide we will look at 2 of them: cylinder, sphere, and smooth.


### Cylinder brush
Let's start by making a cylinder brush. Here is an example of me creating a brush and making a road at the speed of light.

### Sphere brush
Now, Grab another item and make a sphere brush. Spheres can be used for some very basic terraforming, but I recommend using other plugins for that, such as VoxelSniper. 

I am however going to show you some very fast and basic terraforming using these 2 brushes:

`//br sphere stone 4` `//br smooth` (This brush is used to smooth out weird areas and sharp corners)


### Sand Tips
Sand is a very useful block to use, since it falls.

**Tip 1:** You can use sand to cover your terrain in grass, snow, or whatever you want. Simply set a layer of sand in the air above your terrain, then break a block. Once the sand has landed, replace the sand with the block you want to cover your terrain in.

**Tip 2:** When making hills using the sphere brush, Make sand spheres! Why? Well, W/E knows that sand falls, so when you spawn a sand sphere, no blocks will spawn floating in the air, they will auto-fall and leave no weird overhangs. This will save you some time when polishing the terrain afterwards.
Just replace the sand with stone (or whatever) once you are done.
