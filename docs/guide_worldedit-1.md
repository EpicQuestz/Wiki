### What is World Edit?

WorldEdit (W/E For short) is a plugin that allows you to modify large amounts of blocks using commands. There are many different tools that are used for similar tasks, such as _VoxelSniper_. WorldEdit is the easiest tool to use and is a great one to learn first.

### Important to Note

* W/E Commands are ALWAYS written using `//` instead of `/` as you will notice in the coming paragraphs.Â 
* `//undo` will undo your latest W/E command, it can be very useful if you mess something up while experimenting.
* `//redo` will undo your latest undo.

### Getting Started (//wand)

* While using W/E, You will need multiple tools. Now I will teach you about the Wand, and a few commands that you can use it for.
* The Wand is usually a Wooden Axe, but on EpicQuestz that has been changed to a Golden Axe. You can either grab one from your inventory, or type `//wand` in chat.
* The Wand is used for selecting the area that you are going to modify with your commands. You can select two positions by left & right-clicking two blocks using your Wand.
* Everything in between these blocks will get modified.

### //set

:::note Usage
`//set [block]`
:::

* This is the most basic command there is, it will set the area that you have selected, to whatever block you choose.
* The most basic way of using this command would be changing the floor of your plot, Simply select two opposing corners on your plot and type this command.

### //replace

:::note Usage
`//replace [blockA] [blockB]`
:::

* It's pretty self-explanatory. You choose one type of block (block A) to replace with another (block B), in the area that you have selected.

### //copy & //paste

:::note Usage
`//copy` -> `//paste`
:::

* These are very useful commands when working on bigger projects, use //copy to copy the selected area and //paste to paste it.
* Keep in mind that the structure will be copied in relation to where your character is standing/flying. So make sure you stand on the ground, right in front of the structure as you copy it. It will make the pasting a lost easier. You will most likely have to use //undo a lot when getting used to these commands, so be prepared for a lot of messed-up pastes.


### Mixing Blocks

:::note Usage
`//set 50%[Block],20%[Block],30%[Block]`
:::

* You might want mountains, roads, etc. to consist of a mixture of blocks. This is how to do it.
* This can be used for pretty much any W/E command where you choose what blocks to use, it will be very important to know when you start using brushes in the next tutorial.
