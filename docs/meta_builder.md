**Promotion to Builder requires two steps:**
1. Filling out this form: https://forms.gle/u9PnZ6FK1Peb2hvC7
2. An in-game situational assessment.

**If successful in step 1, we will contact you over Discord as to the next steps.**

Step 2 comprises a number (usually two) of situational build assessments, depending on the answers you gave in Step 1. This could comprise (but is not limited to):

* Decorating an interior
* Following a style and designing a house in a street
* Completing some terrain
* Adding atmosphere to a pre-existing build

This in-game trial does not have a time-limit, but we expect you to complete it in good time.

If you have any questions, do not hesitate to contact staff on Discord.

**If successful in step 2, you will be promoted to Builder.**
