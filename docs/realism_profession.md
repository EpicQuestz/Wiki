## Quick Examples

:::tip

Small places would have fewer specialisations. Larger places would have multiple specialisations as well as duplicates.

:::

### Woodworkers

A fancy town may not just have a simple carpenter, but:

- a carpenter specialised in making furniture (i.e: a cabinetmaker)
- or specifically in joining wood (i.e: a joiner).
- or any other specialisations


### Goldworkers

A village or small town would not have anyone dealing in gold. A large town may have one or two, and a city will have a number. But in a city, everyone wonâ€™t be doing the same thing to the gold, they will have **different specialisations**:

- A goldsmith generally deals in the crafting of gold and precious metals.
- A goldbeater turns gold into gold foil.
- A gilder applies gold foil to things.
- A wiredrawer makes gold into gold wire.

It is unlikely that a wiredrawer would have a shop all to himself, but a gilder or goldbeater might.


:::note One shop, many specialities...

In smaller towns, instead of having 4 separate shops for these 4 specialisations, one might simply have a Goldsmith with 4 employees, each specialised in a specific part of goldmaking.

## Paris as an Example

:::tip

Usually in a large city, all similar professions would be on the same street. E.g: Baker Street, Shambles, etc.

:::

1. I have included a chart of **the most common professions in Paris** in the High Medieval period. This is not intended to instruct, just to give you an idea of what was common at the time. Paris, however, was a far, far vaster city than anything we have created so the fact it had 366 shoemakers is clearly out of proportion for what we are going for.

1. The 34 blacksmiths, or 197 tailors, etc, will have done things slightly differently and may have had different specialities, and so on.

1. It will be up to *you*, *your judgement* of the build, and *your knowledge* of this document, to decide whether to add 3 blacksmiths to your large town, or one blacksmith, one billier, and one swordsmith.
